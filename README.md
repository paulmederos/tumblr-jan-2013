Here you'll find my Tumblr template for 2013. It's an eternal work-in-progress, but I wanted 
to share with you to help you build your own Tumblr theme if you'd like.

Few things to note:

1.) Please remove my Google Analytics code and replace with yours (if you have one.)
2.) Please do not sell this template. If you modify it (or use it as a base) and want to sell it, just ask me :) That answer is probably yes.

If you found this useful, please let me know over on Twitter @pvm.
